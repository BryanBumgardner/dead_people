A movie project analyzing death counts in movies, and how that count influences revenue, budget and rating.

February - March 2016

### Death is a fact of life.
That being said, it's worth studying how it fits in our popular culture. 

### Roadmap
#### data: contains pickles of various data sets to promote reproducibility. 
#### scripts: various scripts done outside of the IPython notebook.
#### movie_deaths_notebook: a detailed walkthrough of the process, including visualizations. 


### Major questions:
1. Is the amount of on-screen deaths going up in modern movies?
2. Does a movie's death count have an effect on that movie's domestic gross?
3. Does a movie's death count have an effect on that movie's rating? 
4. How does budget factor into a movie's death count?
5. Is there a relationship between the movie's MPAA rating and body count?

Check out the IPython notebook to see the process. This project is currently ongoing.
