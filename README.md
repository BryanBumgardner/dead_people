# dead_people
A movie project analyzing death counts in movies, and how that count influences revenue, budget and rating.

### Death is a fact of life.
That being said, it's worth studying how it fits in our popular culture. During the Metis Data Science bootcamp (shameless plug), while working on another project I discovered bodycounters.com[http://www.bodycounters.com/]. The dedicated volunteers at this site count and categorize the number of deaths in movies, and to date, have counted for over 2,000 movies. Go grab some beers, count the dead people in your favorite movie, and contribute to the site.
The data are sitting on their site for anyone to see, and it gave me an idea. I reached out to the site and had some correspondence with Dana, who was gracious enough to share a CSV of all the data. I then cross referenced this data with information from another site, thenumbers.com, which shares basic budget and financial information about thousands of movies. I took this data, mashed it together, and asked some questions.
Thanks again to the volunteers at bodycounters. Y'all are the greatest. Below is a quick data science passion project to analyze and find patterns in this great data you've collected.

### Major questions:
1. Is the amount of on-screen deaths going up in modern movies?
2. Does a movie's death count have an effect on that movie's domestic gross?
3. Does a movie's death count have an effect on that movie's rating? 
4. How does budget factor into a movie's death count?
5. Is there a relationship between the movie's MPAA rating and body count?

Check out the IPython notebook to see the process. This project is currently ongoing.
