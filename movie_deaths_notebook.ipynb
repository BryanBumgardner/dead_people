    "That being said, it's worth studying how it fits in our popular culture. During the Metis Data Science bootcamp (shameless plug), while working on another project I discovered bodycounters.com[http://www.bodycounters.com/]. The dedicated volunteers at this site count and categorize the number of deaths in movies, and to date, have counted for over 2,000 movies. Go grab some beers, count the dead people in your favorite movie, and contribute to the site. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data are sitting on their site for anyone to see, and it gave me an idea. I reached out to the site and had some correspondence with Dana, who was gracious enough to share a CSV of all the data. I then cross referenced this data with information from another site, thenumbers.com, which shares basic budget and financial information about thousands of movies. I took this data, mashed it together, and asked some questions. \n",
